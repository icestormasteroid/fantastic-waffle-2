<h2>The Predecessors</h2>
<p>Hitman Absolution is perhaps one of the most adventurous steps a game has taken. What absolution did was change everything that was familiar to a hitman fan. The first thing that players will notice about this game is the linearity of the level designs. All the hitman games before this, and the games after this all have open level designs. Every single level plays out in a scripted manner and there is only one way that the game forces you to play the level.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>!!Warning Spoilers below!!
This below section is from the <strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-04-gamers-devs-slam-hitman-absolution-promotion-that-invites-you-to-identify-female-facebook-friends-by-their-small-tits-and-then-kill-them">hitman wiki page</a></strong> because I never finished the game and I am unable to tell you what happens.</p>
<p>The genetically engineered assassin Agent 47 (David Bateson) receives a contract from his employers, the International Contract Agency (ICA), to kill his former handler Diana Burnwood (Marsha Thomason), who betrayed the ICA for unknown reasons and sabotaged their funding and database, forcing them to reform. When he confronts Diana, 47 learns that she betrayed the ICA to protect a genetically-engineered teenage girl named Victoria (Isabelle Fuhrman) from a life of violence as an assassin. As Diana seemingly dies after being shot by 47, he agrees to protect Victoria, causing his new handler, Benjamin Travis (Powers Boothe), to brand him a traitor.</p>
<p>After dropping Victoria off at the Redwood Orphanage in Chicago, 47, seeking information about her and the ICA, meets disgraced Agency informant Birdie (Steven Bauer), who asks him to assassinate a local crime boss (James Sie). After the hit, Birdie informs him of Blake Dexter (Keith Carradine), head of a home defense system company, who has taken an interest in Victoria. 47 sneaks into Dexter's room at the Terminus Hotel and learns that he is planning to kidnap Victoria and sell her to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to kill Dexter, but is knocked out, framed for the murder of a maid, and left to die in Dexter's suite, which has been set on fire. After escaping from the hotel and the police, he kills Dexter's informant Dom Osmond (Jon Curry) at his strip club, but learns of a group of mercenaries led by Edward Wade (Larry Cedar) hired by Dexter to capture Victoria. Despite 47's efforts to stop them, they capture Birdie, who betrays Victoria's location to save himself. 47 defends Victoria at the orphanage and kills Wade, but Dexter's son Lenny (Shane Stevens) grabs Victoria and escapes.</p>
<p>In the town of Hope, South Dakota, firmly ruled by Dexter's private military company, 47 eliminates Lenny's gang, the &quot;Hope Cougars&quot;, who were planning to kidnap Victoria from Dexter and sell her to a rival weapons company, and interrogates Lenny over Victoria's location before killing him or leaving him to die in the desert. He later infiltrates Dexter Industries' laboratory to kill the scientists who examined Victoria and destroy their research data on her, and kills Dexter's deformed bodyguard Sanchez (Isaac C. Singleton Jr.) in an underground cage fight. While recuperating at a hotel, 47 is attacked by &quot;The Saints&quot;, Travis's personal hit squad, but manages to eliminate them, causing a furious Travis to send a larger group of ICA operatives after him.</p>
<p>47 eventually finds Victoria in the Hope Courthouse jail, but is captured and tortured by Dexter, until the latter is called off to a meeting with Travis, who wants to buy Victoria for $10 million. 47 escapes into the streets and pursues Hope's corrupt sheriff Clive Skurky (Jon Gries), who is on Dexter's payroll, while avoiding ICA agents searching for him. After being cornered, Skurky reveals that Dexter is heading back to Chicago, and is killed by 47. Returning to Chicago, 47 infiltrates Blackwater Park, where Travis is meeting with Dexter to buy Victoria, and kills Dexter's secretary Layla Stockton (Traci Lords), before pursuing Dexter himself to the top of the park. Dexter tries to escape with Victoria on a helicopter after ordering his men to blow up the building, but 47 mortally wounds him and rescues Victoria. After lamenting the loss of his son and money, Dexter is left to die alone.</p>
<p>Several months later, Travis and his men visit Diana's grave, suspecting she has faked her death, but 47 ambushes them, as he was tasked to do so in a letter left by Diana, which also mentioned that Victoria was created by Travis's funding without his ICA superiors' knowledge. After 47 wounds him, Travis rants at him for wasting Victoria's potential for the ICA, and asks whether Diana is really dead, to which 47 responds &quot;You will never know&quot; before killing him. It is later revealed that Diana did in fact fake her death with 47's help, and is looking after Victoria at her mansion, while 47 watches them from the distance.</p>
<p>The game ends with a message from Diana to 47 welcoming him back to the ICA and thanking him for his help. The message also reveals that every mission undertaken by 47 since Blood Money was part of an elaborate plan by Diana to purge the ICA of internal corruption and eliminate Travis's efforts to create cloned assassins. In the final scene, Detective Cosmo Faulkner (Jonathan Adams), who has been tracking 47 since the Terminus Hotel fire, is having trouble discovering 47's identity until Birdie appears and offers to help him for a price.</p>
<h2>Gameplay Changes</h2>
<p>Like the games before Absolution, it is a 3rd person action/adventure stealth game. However, that is mostly where the similarities from the previous games end. Absolution was a reimagining of how hitman works. IO attempted to reinvent the wheel when it came to the gameplay, but this decision is the foundation for a large amount of criticism for the game got.</p>
<h3>What Changed?</h3>
<p>One of the first things the player might notice is that the inventory system got a massive overhaul. Players can no longer hoard every item the find in a level and explore fun ways to use them. The new inventory system now comes with 8 slots, and each one of the slots is dedicated to one type of item. This largely restricts the players creativity within the gameplay and was noticeably criticized upon release.</p>
<p>The second and most notable change is to how levels are presented to the player. Originally the predecessorâ€™s levels were open sandboxes where players are meant to explore the map and find creative ways to assassinate their target. Players could plan what items they wanted to take with them into the mission and upgrade their weapons before it started. Although you can unlock items and outfits in absolution, you cannot use them in missions. The only place you can used your unlocked goods is in contracts mode which the devas recently stopped supporting by shutting the servers down. In hitman Absolution the levels are presented in a linear fashion. This means that the level plays out in a go from point A to point B in one fashion. This contrasts the sandbox levels present in the older games where the users were able to explore and accomplish the task in any manner they. There are now larger environments, however the environment is now broken into smaller levels, and those several mini levels construct the larger environment.</p>
<p>The final noticeable change is to the disguise system.
Like the previous Hitman titles, Absolution also relies on disguise system to complete a mission. However, the disguise detection system has been changed completely from previous games, as the people wearing similar clothes to that of 47 can see through his disguise faster, even from a medium distance, while others cannot see though it. Players can use instinct ability to blend into environment and act casually, thus eradicating the chances of detection through disguises.</p>
<p>Disguises are an integral part of how hitman works. Dressing up as different people to blend into areas you do not belong was a core gameplay mechanic in the previous games and it made sense. To progress in a level in the previous games you must disguise yourself and blend into your environment. Although hitman absolution has disguises, they are nothing more than glorified skins for your character. No matter how you look you will always be suspicious to every AI in the game unless you use the new instinct vision mechanic. Instinct vision is a gameplay gimmick which allows Agent 47 to monitor enemies more easily and make you look less suspicious to AI. The mechanic worked by holding a button that depleted the Instinct meter, and if the instinct meter ran out your disguise no longer works even though you have it on. Depending on what difficulty you play on the meter may not fill back up meaning that when it is empty every disguise will have no disguising effect. The instinct system making the disguise system redundant was the biggest criticism of the game.</p>
<h3>What stayed the same?</h3>
<p>Not every aspect of hitman absolution's gameplay was negative. Although it did not share a lot in common was its previous games, it would share a lot in common with the future entries in the series. Infect one would say most of the core mechanics were the foundation for the future reboot series. One of the biggest changes to Hitman is that they added a cover system. Agent 47 could now snap to cover such as walls, barricades, and poles among other things to help conceal his position in the environment. This has remained in the newer hitman games and works well in them.</p>
<p>The item targeting system has also remained in the newer games. The new targeting system automatically snaps your aim to the nearest enemy if you have a throwable item equipped. This makes it. The targeting system is also expanded upon with a new gameplay mechanic exclusive to this game called 'Point Shooting'. What would happen is after a certain amount of you get an ability to freeze time, mark your targets and it would auto assassinate them in a quick range. This mechanic felt largely out of place in a Hitman game because playing out a scenario like the end of a Scarface feels a bit out of place for a game focused on stealth.</p>
<p>The final thing that stayed the same for future entries was the control scheme. For the most part the button layout stayed the exact same. The new melee attack controls also remained the same to future entries.</p>
<h3>So why was Absolution so different?</h3>
<p>When IO were developing the concepts for the game around 2008 the most popular games at the time were max Payne 3, Gears of War. You can see the similarities between those games and absolution. Like all big game studios, they were trying to make their game to feel familiar to those popular games at the time to appeal to the largest audience. The reason that it took so long to release is because the developers did not believe that the tech was present to make the game experience that they wanted. It took over seven years of development and by the end people had moved on the story driven experiences like Max Payne 3, and Gears of war leaving hitman absolution in an awkward state where it already felt like a dated game when it came out.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Hitman absolution seriously got the devs to reconsider the strategy of how they made hitman games. Although Hitman Absolution was received well amongst the critics the fans were not pleased with its entry. IO interactive stated in an open letter to the community that noted that absolution had its faults and they learned how to improve. They highlighted that the series would go back to its roots building off the concepts of absolution while taking inspiration from their critically acclaimed previous titles like Hitman: Blood Money.</p>
<p>In 2016 IO released the first Hitman game to what would be a trilogy that concluded with Hitman 3's release in 2020. The recent games featured the largest sandbox levels that the series has ever seen. It has improved graphics, gameplay, and story over the Absolution.</p>
<p>The developer IO interactive also went through many changes after Absolution released. Square Enix had stated that hitman absolution had failed to meet their sale expectations for 2012. Subsequently Io interactive reformed any almost half of its staff was laid off. Although this could be a coincidence it may be safe to assume that those two things are related. Square enix would also let IO interactive go in 2017 leaving the developers to be picked up by the publishers Warner Bros. Interactive for Hitman 2. It is unknown what happened between Warner Bros. and IO, but IO decided to publish hitman 3 themselves. Currently IO Interactive is working on Project 007, this will most likely be their main project for the next few years leaving fans of the hitman games to patiently wait for an announcement for the next hitman project.</p>
<h2>Bonus: Ad Campaign Disaster</h2>
<p>Hitman Absolution featured one of the worst marketing campaigns for any form of media I have ever seen. Posted and taken down on the same day, Hitman Absolution had a unique Facebook app where users identify and threaten Facebook friends for assassination. Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, this tool was used for mass cyberbullying online. The crude nature of the descriptions of why you wanted to assassinate someone and how you would describe said person also largely contributed to the negative nature in which this tool was used. The developers took the app down and issued a public apology and agreed that it was in bad taste.</p>
